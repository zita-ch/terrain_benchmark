this folder contains codes that obtained the terrain generation model

pls create folders with these names in advance:
+ outputs
+ outputs_test
+ data_downsampled_blurred 
+ world_map

I took these names from the [sketch-to-terrain](https://github.com/nanoxas/sketch-to-terrain) repo, but I did not do the downsampling, and made a lot of changes for my own task! Despite this, the [sketch-to-terrain](https://github.com/nanoxas/sketch-to-terrain) repo did save my time a lot.
